    "generate-sw": "workbox generate:sw"
in package.json, we use the generate-sw command to generate a brand new service worker, that worked great and 
it analyzed all our files and added them automatically for precaching.
Now if we want to build up on an existing service worker file as we do here, we can't use that because
generate-sw will always generate a brand new file which only does precaching.

    "generate-sw": "workbox inject:manifest"
This basically means take an existing file, analyze all my assets and create this manifest you generate here already,
so take this array (service-worker file, variable fileManifest) and then inject it into my manually created file.
Now of course for this to work, we have to give workbox some additional information.
